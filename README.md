# rewinos
A small ios app to keep notes about wine we liked
Back in 1995 I wrote a program to catalogue wine. 
Given the year this inevitably ended up being called Winos 95.
The limitations of storage and my coding ability meant that the original Winos didn't store an archive
The aim here is a) to learn more about Swift UI b) to keep track of wines we liked.
